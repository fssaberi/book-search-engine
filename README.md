# Book Search Engine

## Description

This application is a search engine for books! As a reader, you can search for new books you are interested in, and keep a list of these books to purchase later.

## Software

This application was created using JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Node.js/Express.js, GraphQL, and Apollo Server, in Visual Studio Code. Heroku and Playground were used, as well.

## Application

When the user begins using the search engine, they see a menu with options to look for books and login or signup. If they click on the option to search for books, they can enter a book title and click on the submit button. The user will see the search results, which will include the following for each book that pops up: title, author, description, image, and a link to Google Books for that specific book. The user also has the option to log in or sign up on the site. When the user selects the signup option, they are prompted to enter a username, their email address, and a password. If they have already signed up, they can click on the login option, and they will be prompted to enter their email address and password. Once the user is logged in, they will have an added feature- their saved books. If they do a search while logged in, they have the option to save books, and also to a feature that shows them all their saved books. The user also has the option to remove a saved book from their list, which they can do by clicking on the remove button. Once the user is done, they can log out by clicking on the logout button.
